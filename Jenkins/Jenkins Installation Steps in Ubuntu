It looks like Jenkins requires a newer version of Java (Java 17 or Java 21) to run. You can upgrade your Java version to meet this requirement. Here's how you can install Java 17 on Ubuntu:

### Step 1: Add the OpenJDK 17 Repository
1. Open a terminal and add the OpenJDK 17 repository:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
```

### Step 2: Update Your Package List
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 3: Install OpenJDK 17
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

### Step 4: Verify the Installation
Check the Java version to ensure it's correctly installed:
```bash
java -version
```

### Step 5: Start Jenkins Using Java 17
Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `jenkins.war` file and start Jenkins:
```bash
java -jar jenkins.war
```

You should now be able to access Jenkins at `http://localhost:8080` without any version compatibility issues.

Does this help resolve your issue?



Got it! Here are the steps to install Apache and configure it to serve Jenkins at `http://jenkins.aig`:

### Step 1: Install Apache
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install Apache:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```

### Step 2: Enable Required Apache Modules
1. Enable the necessary Apache modules for proxying:
```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

### Step 3: Configure Apache Virtual Host
1. Create a new virtual host configuration file for Jenkins:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/jenkins.conf
```
2. Add the following configuration to the file:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName jenkins.aig
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /jenkins http://localhost:8080/jenkins nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse /jenkins http://localhost:8080/jenkins
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/jenkins/(.*) ws://localhost:8080/jenkins/$1 [P,L]
    <Proxy http://localhost:8080/jenkins>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>
</VirtualHost>
```
3. Save and close the file.

### Step 4: Enable the Virtual Host
1. Enable the new virtual host configuration:
```bash
sudo a2ensite jenkins.conf
```

### Step 5: Restart Apache
1. Restart Apache to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 6: Verify Configuration
1. Open your web browser and go to `http://jenkins.aig`. You should see the Jenkins setup screen.

That's it! You should now have Jenkins accessible via `http://jenkins.aig` using Apache as a reverse proxy. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!


Thanks for letting me know. Since Jenkins is running on `localhost:8080`, we need to adjust the Apache configuration to forward requests to this URL properly.

### Step 1: Update Apache Virtual Host Configuration
1. Open the virtual host configuration file for Jenkins:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/jenkins.conf
```
2. Update the configuration to forward the root URL to Jenkins:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName jenkins.aig
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) ws://localhost:8080/$1 [P,L]
    <Proxy http://localhost:8080/>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>
</VirtualHost>
```
3. Save the file and exit the editor.

### Step 2: Disable the Default Apache Site
1. To prevent the default Apache page from appearing, disable the default site:
```bash
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
```

### Step 3: Enable the Jenkins Virtual Host
1. Enable the Jenkins virtual host configuration if it isn't already enabled:
```bash
sudo a2ensite jenkins.conf
```

### Step 4: Restart Apache
1. Restart Apache to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Step 5: Verify DNS Resolution
1. Ensure that the domain name `jenkins.aig` resolves to the IP address of your VM. You can do this by adding an entry in the `/etc/hosts` file on both your VM and your laptop:
```plaintext
192.168.1.100 jenkins.aig
```
Replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual IP address of your VM.

### Step 6: Access Jenkins
1. Open your web browser on your laptop and go to `http://jenkins.aig`. You should now see the Jenkins home page.

If you still encounter issues, please share any error messages or logs you see, and we can troubleshoot further. ðŸ˜Š

No problem! You can still use PuTTY on your Windows laptop to connect to your Ubuntu VM running in VMware Workstation. Here are the steps tailored for a Windows environment:

### Step 1: Download and Install PuTTY
1. **Download PuTTY** from the official website: [PuTTY Download Page](https://www.putty.org/).
2. **Install PuTTY** on your Windows laptop by following the installation prompts.

### Step 2: Configure Network Settings in VMware Workstation
1. **Power off your Ubuntu VM** in VMware Workstation.
2. **Open VMware Workstation** and select your VM.
3. **Go to "Edit"** > **"Virtual Network Editor"**.
4. Select **"Bridged"** under the **"Network connection"** options. This allows your VM to be on the same network as your host machine.
5. **Power on your Ubuntu VM**.

### Step 3: Ensure SSH is Running on Ubuntu VM
1. **Log in to your Ubuntu VM** and open a terminal.
2. Check if the SSH server is installed and running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```
3. If SSH is not installed, install it using:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
4. Start the SSH service if it isn't running:
```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### Step 4: Configure Firewall on Ubuntu VM
1. **Ensure the firewall** on your Ubuntu VM allows SSH connections:
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
```

### Step 5: Add VM's IP to Hosts File on Windows
1. **Open Notepad** as Administrator on your Windows laptop.
2. **Open the hosts file** located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add the following line to map your VM's IP address to the desired domain name (e.g., `jenkins.aig`):
```plaintext
192.168.1.11 jenkins.aig
```
Replace `192.168.1.11` with the actual IP address of your VM.
4. Save the hosts file and close Notepad.

### Step 6: Connect Using PuTTY
1. **Open PuTTY** on your Windows laptop.
2. In the **Host Name (or IP address)** field, enter `192.168.1.11` or `jenkins.aig`.
3. Ensure the **Port** is set to `22` (the default port for SSH).
4. Click **Open** to start the connection.

### Step 7: Check Network Connectivity
1. **Ensure your laptop can reach the VM**. You can test this by pinging the VM's IP address from your Windows laptop:
```plaintext
ping 192.168.1.11
```

These steps should help you establish an SSH connection to your Ubuntu VM using PuTTY on your Windows laptop. If you run into any issues, feel free to let me know! ðŸ˜Š

PS: Once you connect, you should be able to access Jenkins at `http://jenkins.aig`.

It looks like the SSH server is not installed on your Ubuntu VM. Let's get it installed and running:

### Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server
1. Open a terminal in your Ubuntu VM.
2. Run the following command to install the OpenSSH server:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### Step 2: Start the SSH Service
1. Once installed, start the SSH service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

### Step 3: Enable SSH to Start on Boot
1. To ensure the SSH service starts on boot, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Step 4: Verify SSH is Running
1. Check the status of the SSH service to ensure it's running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```
You should see an "active (running)" status.

After following these steps, you should be able to connect to your Ubuntu VM using PuTTY from your Windows laptop.

Let me know how it goes or if you need any more help! ðŸ˜Š
