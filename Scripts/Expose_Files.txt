A simple Python script to create an HTTP server that serves files from the /home/osboxes directory.
This will allow you to access these files from your laptop's browser using the VM's IP address.

Here's a Python3 script to achieve this:

import http.server
import socketserver

# Define the handler to serve files from /home/osboxes
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
handler.directory = "/home/osboxes"

# Define the port to expose
PORT = 8000

# Create the server object
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), handler) as httpd:
    print(f"Serving files from /home/osboxes at http://192.168.1.11:{PORT}")
    # Serve files until interrupted
    httpd.serve_forever()
Steps to Run the Script:
Save the Script:

Save the above script to a file, for example, serve_files.py.
Run the Script:

Open a terminal in your Ubuntu VM.
Navigate to the directory where you saved serve_files.py.
Run the script using Python3:
python3 serve_files.py
Access the Files:

Open a browser on your laptop.
Go to http://192.168.1.11:8000.
You should see the directory listing of /home/osboxes and be able to access the files.
Troubleshooting:
Port Already in Use:

If you encounter an error indicating that the port is already in use, you can either stop the process using that port or choose a different port by changing the PORT variable in the script.
Firewall Settings:

Ensure that your VM's firewall allows incoming connections on the specified port (8000 in this case). You can allow the port using:
sudo ufw allow 8000
sudo ufw reload
